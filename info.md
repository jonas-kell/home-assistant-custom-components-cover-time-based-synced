# Cover Time Based Component Synced version

Cover Time Based Component for your [Home-Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io) based on [davidramosweb's Cover Time Based Component](https://github.com/davidramosweb/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-time-based) and [nagyrobi's Cover RF Time based](https://github.com/nagyrobi/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-rf-time-based/),
modified to sync state of cover with the state of switches.

### Usage

### Example configuration.yaml entry

```yaml
cover:
    - platform: cover_time_based_synced
      devices:
          my_room_cover_time_based:
              name: My Room Cover
              travelling_time_up: 36
              travelling_time_down: 34
              close_switch_entity_id: switch.rf_myroom_cover_down
              open_switch_entity_id: switch.rf_myroom_cover_up
              send_stop_at_ends: False #optional
              delay_before_stop_at_ends: 0.5 #optional
              aliases: #optional
                  - my_room_cover_time_based
```

All mandatory settings self-explanatory.
Optional settings:

-   `send_stop_at_ends` defaults to `False`. If set to `True`, the Stop script will be run after the cover reaches to 0 or 100 (closes or opens completely). This is for people who use interlocked relays in the scripts to drive the covers, which need to be released when the covers reach the end positions.
-   `delay_before_stop_at_ends` delays the sending of the stop command (that is triggered if `send_stop_at_ends` is set to `True`) by the specified amount of time. This is uesfull, if the cover motors have end position detection and need some time to execute their shutdown sequence after the end positions are reached.
-   `aliases`: to override the entity name generated by Home Assistant internally from the (friendly) name.
